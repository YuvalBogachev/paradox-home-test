How to run the code:
---------------------------------------------------
You can use one of two options:
1. The notebook.
2. The raw python code.

In both of them you need to provide an API key in
either the matching cell or api_key.py.

For the noteook use any supported python notebook
platform and simply run all the cells. The last
cell is where al the interaction happens.

For the raw python code, first you need to install 
the required libraries, using requirements.txt.
Then you can generate the camp description using
generate_camp_text.py. I have provided the text
that was generated for me in genai_info.py and it
is what is being used in the code. After that
simply run main.py and interact with the bot.
