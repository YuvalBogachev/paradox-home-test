My Approach:
---------------------------------------------------
At first I wanted to build a multi agent
environment where each prompt will act on it own
and they will communicate with each other. This
would allow greater flexability and more context.
However, it proved to be more difficult to manage
than a series of prompts. So I decided on 
combining the 3 prompts using a template to allow
for a single unit of execution for ease of use and
better debugging. I had some trouble with the
prompt correctly identifying the information from
the GenAI summer camp, so I decieded to enginner
another prompt that will output the details in
JSON for ease of parsing by the main prompt.
The mega prompt is essentialy my agents ideas
condenced to a single prompt. He correctly
greets the user and knows how when to pass to
inquiry or signup due to explcit instrudctions
on how to do so. We than provide the JSON of
camp information so the other prompts will know
about the camp. We define explicitly for every
option after greeting (and in greeting) what the
user input might be, while allowing some flexibility,
essntaially making the best of both worlds.
